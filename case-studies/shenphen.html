                    <p>Shenphen Ling, a non-profit Dharma center, came to me to learn how it could refresh its brand identity and unearth exciting ways to deliver the spiritual development experience. We designed an entirely new platform using an education-first strategy that enables effortless access to resources surrounding Buddhism.</p>

                    <p>When Shenphen Ling approached me in January 2016, I was intrigued. As a member, I knew the center had created a <a href="http://www.shenphenling.org">website</a> soon after opening its doors in 2004 yet never promoted it. A second <a href="http://www.shenphenling.org">website</a> launched in 2011 but remains unfinished and garners minimal traffic. In recent years, Shenphen Ling has observed the growing public interest in Buddhist practice and philosophy. To spread the Dharma to a new generation of learners, they needed to reboot their organizational platform - and that’s where I came in.</p>
                    <p>In Taiwan, Shenphen Ling’s principal center has built up a huge following of learners familiar with its resources and activities, aided by the country’s massive Buddhist network. In the US, Shenphen Ling has been a much smaller operation. With an existing cache of free resources and a revered spiritual teacher guiding their practice, Shenphen Ling wanted a website capable of reaching a larger American audience.</p>

The redesign facilitates quick searching and comprehensive filtering, allowing visitors to view, download, or share content at their own convenience. While the focus remains on Dharma education, patrons can also learn about the center, request special services, and save events to personal calendars, all within one intuitive platform.</p>

I returned to my SWOT analysis to assess my competitors’ approaches and tested apps from indirect competitors, including Foursquare, Hotel Tonight, and ChefsFeed. From this, I concluded that providing a delightful introduction and allowing exploration of basic features would persuade users to sign up to continue the experience with additional features.</p>

                    <p>The product’s central premise was to locate outdoor play spaces that were close by, safe, and enjoyable for children, not unlike the backyard of one’s home. The word “backyard” also came up in several conversations between parents that I witnessed which inspired this project - how, given today’s housing market, families often cannot afford homes with a yard for kids to roam and explore, but they still want to encourage their kids to play in nature and learn to socialize; or how parents often came across public playgrounds near their homes on random walks that they hadn’t realized existed there. I wanted to capture the feelings of proximity and exploration in an open, natural, familial space, and “Backyard” was thereby born.</p>
                    <p>From there, Backyard needed a logo to communicate the product’s function, key message, and personality. My design started as literal park benches and trees and evolved into a simple line illustration of a leaf-cum-magnifying glass to convey the product’s simplicity with some whimsy.</p>
