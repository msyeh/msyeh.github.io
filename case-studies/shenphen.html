                    <p>Shenphen Ling, a non-profit Dharma center, came to me to learn how it could refresh its brand identity and unearth exciting ways to deliver the spiritual development experience. We designed an entirely new platform using an education-first strategy that enables effortless access to resources surrounding Buddhism.</p>

                    <p>When Shenphen Ling approached me in January 2016, I was intrigued. As a member, I knew the center had created a <a href="http://www.shenphenling.org" target="_blank">website</a> soon after opening its doors in 2004 yet never promoted it. A second <a href="http://www.shenphenling.org" target="_blank">website</a> launched in 2011 but remains unfinished. In recent years, Shenphen Ling has observed the growing public interest in Buddhist practice and philosophy. To spread the Dharma to a new generation of learners, they needed to reboot their organizational platform - and that’s where I came in.</p>
                    <p>In Taiwan, Shenphen Ling’s principal center has built up a huge following of learners familiar with its resources and activities, aided by the country’s massive Buddhist network. In the US, Shenphen Ling has been a much smaller operation. With an existing cache of free resources and a revered spiritual teacher guiding their practice, Shenphen Ling wanted a website capable of reaching a larger American audience.</p>

The redesign facilitates quick searching and comprehensive filtering, allowing visitors to view, download, or share content at their own convenience. While the focus remains on Dharma education, patrons can also learn about the center, request special services, and save events to personal calendars, all within one intuitive platform.</p>

                    <p>Molengo’s lines for stems, ascenders, and descenders mirrored the fine lines of Shenphen Ling’s existing bodhi leaf icon. Large counters and ear shapes also mimicked the icon’s curves and flourishes. Its predictable portions indicate better readability, but a humanist aspect allows the type to feel more natural instead of overly perfect. For my paragraph text, I chose Lato for its harmony of warm semi-rounded details with a strong structure. Used in almost 8 million websites, Lato’s geometric qualities boost readability and its multiple styles can be used to achieve content hierarchy without losing consistency.</p>

                    <p>During interviews, stakeholders made clear that they did not want to rename the business or alter the existing bodhi leaf icon. Coined by the teacher, <i>Shenphen Ling</i> translated from Tibetan means, “a place of meaningful benefit to others.” The bodhi leaf icon was also drawn by the teacher and consists of a simple line drawing of a bodhi leaf with the Tibetan word <i>Di</i>, meaning “wisdom,” in its center.</p>
                    <p>My approach to designing the new logo was to keep it simple and versatile. I wanted to highlight the icon’s symmetry and mirror its aura of calm and trust. After experimenting with varying type sizes and positioning, we decided on a design with increased character tracking to imitate the spacing of veins on the leaf and stacked text placement to reflect the arrangement of the leaf and stem.</p>

To gather inspiration, I applied color psychology to our desired product reaction words, assembled a <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/SG354A2TQBPKY/" target="_blank">moodboard</a>, and reviewed Shenphen Ling’s database of existing images. To avoid having our graphic elements compete with the vibrant photographs, we selected a palette of calm blues and greens with one eye-grabbing pop of bright orange as a tribute to Tibetan red and yellow. This color palette, along with our logo and typefaces, were then combined into a cohesive styleguide.</p>

                    <p>Users loved our fresh approach to a religious platform and were delighted by the cheerfulness and simplicity of our initial prototype. After 6 weeks of research, design, and testing, my collaboration with Shenphen Ling continues into the development stage as we work towards launching the current version of our prototype and observing Google Analytics for further improvements.</p>
                    <p>With more time, I would like to explore an alternative design to our information architecture - renaming "Learn Buddhism" and "Practice with Us" to "Our Resources" and "Our Practices" - and conduct A/B testing to gauge differences in performance.</p>
                    <p>This partnership has taught me the importance of documenting the design process in a manner that stakeholders can understand, as well as being open to new approaches for communicating with clients. I had a lot of fun running design reviews with stakeholders as usability tests, and I look forward to learning more with each design sprint.</p>
