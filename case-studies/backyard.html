                        <li>The majority used Google and Yelp and praised their convenience, speed, and availability of information; but just because a lot of information was available did not mean it was all there, or that it was all correct;</li>
                        <li>Respondents also complained that filters didn’t allow for enough customization and that search results were overwhelming to navigate through.</li>

I completed a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B57iLHS7RoSgcS1tRGhyRWtKZGs" target="_blank">SWOT analysis</a> of five competitors: a mix of mobile apps, mobile sites, and web sites, each claiming to help families find playgrounds around their location. Ultimately, looking at existing user reviews, testing out the apps, and examining screenshots in detail helped me identify key areas that I could build upon and improve. Most surprisingly, an app that I noted to be crudely basic was highly rated for its functional, no-nonsense utility; this was a good warning to check my biases.</p>

This took several iterations as I experimented with whether or not to require users to sign up prior to accessing specifics features or all of the content. I returned to my SWOT analysis to assess my competitors’ approaches and tested apps from indirect competitors, including Foursquare, Hotel Tonight, and ChefsFeed. From this, I concluded that providing a delightful introduction and allowing exploration of basic features would persuade users to sign up to continue the experience with additional features.</p>

                    <p>The product’s central premise was to locate outdoor play spaces that were close by, safe, and enjoyable for children, not unlike the backyard of one’s home. The word “backyard” also came up in several conversations between parents that I witnessed which inspired this project - how, given today’s housing market, families often cannot afford homes with a yard for kids to roam and explore, but they still want to encourage their kids to play in nature and learn to socialize; or how parents often came across public playgrounds near their homes on random walks that they hadn’t realized existed there. I wanted to capture the feelings of proximity and exploration in an open, natural, familial space, and “Backyard” was thereby born.</p>
                    <p>From there, Backyard needed a logo to communicate the product’s function, key message, and personality. My design started as literal park benches and trees and evolved into a simple line illustration of a leaf-cum-magnifying glass to convey the product’s simplicity with some whimsy.</p>

                    <p>I began with a pencil and paper to quickly sketch a low-fidelity prototype, focusing on providing opportunities to quickly narrow down search results and on minimizing the complexities of pinpointing family-oriented details. Rather than reinventing the wheel, I conducted multiple pattern analyses to extrapolate key elements of search, filter, view, and edit flows that met my criteria for convenience, speed, and organized simplicity.</p>
                    <p>Using paper prototypes allowed me to draw up several concept alternatives for the search, view, and edit screens, upon which I conducted basic user testing and preference tests. Feedback pointed me towards navigation and content organization as the top user priorities to keep in mind as I turned to Sketch to begin creating wireframes.</p>

                        <li>Because time and accuracy were equally important to users, I overhauled the Review screen after exploring how to generate accurate ratings using yes/no questions, a checklist, or behavioral data gathered as a whole. </li>

                    <p>Working on this project also taught me the importance of organizing content to fit the needs of the specific user. Convenience and speed were real demands born out of parents’ demanding real-world needs, and every little detail that can shred seconds off completing a task is crucial.</p>
